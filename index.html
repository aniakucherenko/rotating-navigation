          This is a complete guide to the miniature Labrador. It will help you
          to understand how Labradors are bred in smaller sizes, and why
          breeders have made the choice to shrink them down. We’ll look at the
          differences between full sized and mini Labs, the ethics of breeding
          them to be shorter, and help you decide whether this is the right pet
          for you. Do you love Labradors, but worry about having the space in
          your life for a full sized adult Then you could be forgiven for
          looking for a small Labrador breed. One with their perfect personality
          in a miniature Labrador body. But do these dream dogs really exist? We
          will investigate the dwarf Labrador and the teacup Lab, and help you
          to understand what people mean when they claim to be miniature
          Labrador breeders of any variety.

          If you are beginning to search for a Labrador puppy, you will probably
          have come across a few adverts claiming to be selling Miniature
          Labradors. The idea being that they are producing an exact replica of
          the Labrador, but in miniature. A ‘micro Labrador’, if you will. The
          idea of this is adorable, but in reality these perfectly formed yet
          small size Labradors simply don’t exist. There is only one Labrador
          breed, and that breed has set perimeters for size within the healthy
          average population.
